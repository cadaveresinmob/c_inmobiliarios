Measured Value Field (MVF) is a module that allows you to create fields of measured values, like 5 KGs or 30 inches.

Fields entered with one unit measure can be output in another unit measure. This modules ships with a few very basic unit suggesters - pieces of functionality that suggest units based on current context. These unit suggestions are used whenever it comes to deciding what units to use. The most important use case is MVF fields are output in the suggested unit, i.e. the entered data is converted to the suggested unit automatically right before displaying it on the web page. If the provided unit suggesters are not enough for your needs you can create your own via <a href="&topic:ctools/plugins-implementing&">CTools plugins</a>.
