Measured Value Field (MVF) is a module that allows you to create fields of measured values, like 5 KGs or 30 inches.

Fields entered with one unit measure can be output in another unit measure. This modules ships with a few very basic unit suggesters - pieces of functionality that determine in what unit to output field in a particular context. If the provided unit suggesters are not enough for your needs you can create your own via <a href="&topic:ctools/plugins-implementing&">CTools plugins</a>.
