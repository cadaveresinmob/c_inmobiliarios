getlocations_map module for Drupal 7.x


If you have any questions or suggestions please contact me at
http://drupal.org/user/52366 or use the Getlocations issue queue.

This module provides a field to display a Google map
associated with a Getlocations_fields, Geofield, Geolocation or Location
module enabled content type.

For best results ensure that the locative field is present before adding
Getlocations Map. Go into Manage Fields > Getlocations Map > edit
and save, Do the same in Manage Display.
